# Adversarial Search Algorthms for Games
In the this project, we had to design agents for the zero-sum game Connect Four, where two players take turns dropping colored discs into a 7x6 grid. The objective is to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs of the same color.
Implemented minimax, alpha-beta pruning for minimax, and expectimax algoirthms.
